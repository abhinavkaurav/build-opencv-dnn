Build opencv with Deep Neural Networks (dnn module)

Building openvcv with dnn is a real pain as it requires correct configuratin. But once it is build, it provides great advantages of low level compilations.
It aslo enables to load any model (pytorch, caffe, tensorflow, darknet etc) and provide faster inference than any other with easy to use apis.

This repo include a cmake file with the configuartion required to build opencv with dnn.
